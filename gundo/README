Gtk Undo: Multilevel undo/redo for Gtk
Copyright (C) 1999  Nat Pryce


Introduction
------------

Gundo provides a Gtk object that manages multilevel undo/redo for an 
application.  The object stores a sequence of actions and provides methods 
for undoing or redoing those actions. It fires signals to inform the
application when it is or is not possible to undo or redo any actions. 
Utility functions are provided that react to those signals to keep user 
interface components in sync with the undo sequence.

This is version 0.2. The latest version can be found at:
