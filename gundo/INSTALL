How to install Gtk Undo
-----------------------

IMPORTANT:
   If you have installed a previous version of this library, uninstall
   it, to avoid name-clash with another library named "libundo" and to
   avoid version numbering problems caused by a bug in version 0.1.


1) Read the file named COPYING.  You must agree to the terms of the license
   before making and installing the library.

2) Cd into the src directory

3) Modify the Makefile to reflect your local configuration.

4) Type 'make'.  This will build the library.

5) Optionally, type 'make test' to make and run the tests.  You should get
   the output "./tundo: OK".

6) Optionally make the demo program:
   6.1) Cd into the ../demo directory.
   6.2) Type 'make' to build the demo program.  This will create a program
        called 'sketch'.
   6.3) Run the demo program by typing './sketch'.  Information about how
        to use the program is in the file named "DEMO".
   6.4) Cd back to the ../src directory.
   
7) Optionally, install the library type 'make install'.  This will put the
   static and shared library in the same location as the Gtk libraries. 
   Modify the install and uninstall targets of the Makefile to install
   the library elsewhere.
